This repository demonstrates a scenario where a Python function correctly handles division by zero in one branch, but an error still arises in another branch. This is an uncommon type of error. The bug.py file shows the original code. The bugSolution.py file shows a more robust solution using try-except blocks for a comprehensive error handling approach.
